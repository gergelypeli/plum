A label eats a preceding semicolon, explicit or implicit. But it does not eat
a comma. So

:if x
then: y

is one statement, as is

:if x; then: y

But

(:try x, or: y)

are two arguments, not one with a statement.


Starting a block with a label should be allowed for the same reason as
allowing it in parens:

f(a: 1, b: 2)

f
    a: 1
    b: 2

Line starting labels would also prevent a new statement, but would still
insert a separator, but without statements it would mean quite the same.
